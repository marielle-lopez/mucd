- Created Home page and related components

This project started off with setting up a default React application and stripping it of its unused content. According to the design mockup I created in Figma in November last year, I created variables for the typography and palette colours to be used in this project.

I quickly developed the `NavBar` and `Footer` components which would be displayed on any page of the application. This was followed by creating the Home page and constructing its associated components: `Showcase` and `IntroCard`. I also coded other components that would be re-used across the project, including `Button` and `TextLink`.
